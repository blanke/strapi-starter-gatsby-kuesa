<p>Kuesa 3D Studio is a complete design-to-code workflow solution for 3D in real-time applications. It saves your team a lot of time, and allows your projects to get to market first. To assure independence from particular platforms Kuesa uses the open glTF<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 2.0 format already supported by Blender, Maya, 3ds Max and others.</p>
<p>Kuesa provides a workflow that simplifies work for both designers and developers. It is centered on the glTF 2.0 format. As a result changes made by designers to 3D models require little, if any, work on the developer’s side to integrate into their application. Teams can iterate more frequently, get feedback and fine-tune more often, ensuring that the release is on time. <a href="https://www.kuesa.com/">Find out more&#8230;</a></p>
<h3>What&#8217;s new in Kuesa 1.3?</h3>

Designers can then easily share their work with Developers by creating &#8220;KUESA Animation Groups&#8221; within the Maya Outliner. The Animation Groups are then imported as part of the glTF file, enabling developers access to the corresponding animations directly within KUESA.</div>

<h4>A Complete Design-to-Code Workflow Solution for 3D Assets in Real-time Applications</h4>

<li>free live webinar June 4th, 6pm CEST</li>
</ul>
<h4>Berlin, June 2nd 2020</h4>
<p>Building software that is dependent on real-time 3D models – like for example an automotive dashboard, MRI machine, factory control system or furniture design tool – requires not only 3D designers and 3D programmers. It also demands the ability to bring these very different skill sets together into a smoothly operating workflow.</p>
<p>In conventional workflows, a massive problem is that the assets created by 3D artists can rarely be used by programmers directly, forcing the development team to hand-tweak models and hand-code animations to make things work. It also forces designers to move their designs to target hardware to see how they’ll actually appear. This manual work extends product release timelines, and the artificial wall it creates between 3D artists and software engineers is a bottleneck that prohibits rapid iteration and the fine-tuning required to develop fast and high-quality results.</p>
<p>To eliminate this problem KDAB created KUESA 3D Studio. It makes the collaboration of designers and developers much more manageable by offering a seamless, integrated workflow. Designers can realize their vision using their favorite tools, developers can focus on their strengths without having to deal with design issues, and management can rely on getting better products to market faster.</p>
<h2>How does KUESA 3D Studio work?</h2>
<p>KUESA 3D Studio is comprised of three main components.</p>
<p>The KUESA 3D Design Plugins augment a designer’s preferred digital content creation tools, allowing them to create and export fully accessible 3D scenes and to display content that visually matches the run-time environment.</p>
<p>Many additional utilities are integrated in KUESA 3D Tools for fine-tuning, conditioning, investigating, debugging, and optimizing 3D assets, usable by either designers or developers.</p>
<p>Libraries built on top of Qt and Qt 3D allow developers to integrate 3D scenes directly into applications. This module is called KUESA 3D Runtime.</p>
<h2>What’s new in version 1.2?</h2>
<p>One of the most significant improvements is the Iro Materials Library. Physically-based rendering (PBR) can generate amazing images, but not all embedded systems have enough processing power to handle it. Also, without knowing the actual physics, PBR isn’t easily tweakable to simulate materials such as a pre-defined bitmap that needs to appear glossy. For these cases, or any other where PBR may be overkill, KUESA 3D Studio supports the Iro Material Library. This library provides a catalog of materials that can simulate common surface properties (such as reflections, clear-coated paint, and transparency) and gives great looking results with less designer and GPU overhead.</p>
<p>By default, glTF<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> only allows you to animate transformation properties like translation, rotation, scale. In lots of cases, it would be useful to animate other properties like material properties, camera properties etc. This has now been added through the use of a custom glTF extension.</p>
<p>An additional benefit is brought in by Qt 3D, which KUESA 3D Studio is based on and which is maintained by KDAB. With Qt 3D on Qt 5.15.0 very potent profiling capabilities have been added.</p>
<p>More features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, and Blender, as well as any other glTF-compatible digital content creation tools</li>
<li>Ability to build 3D scenes with PBR, non-PBR, and node-based materials</li>
<li>Real-time performance on desktop and embedded systems</li>
<li>Integration of both 3D and 2D assets</li>
<li>Compressed textures, meshes, and images for faster load times, reduced application size, and optimal use of GPU resources</li>
<li>Full programmatic access to scene items with APIs in C++ and QML</li>
<li>Photo-realistic results consistent across design tools and applications</li>
<li>Special effects like bloom and depth-of-field</li>
<li>Up to date with Qt 3D performance improvements in Qt 5.15</li>
<li>Ability to incorporate tools into a continuous integration system resulting in consistent 3D asset verification and conditioning</li>
<li>Availability of AGPL 3 license for KUESA 3D Runtime</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.kdab.com/kuesa/">KUESA<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> is a solution that provides an integrated and unified workflow for designers and developers to create, optimize and integrate real time 3D content in a 3D or hybrid 2D/3D software user interface. Models, including geometry, materials, animations and more, can smoothly be shared between designers and developers. Kuesa relies on glTF 2.0, an open standard which is being broadly used in the industry, so it can easily and seamlessly integrate with a growing number of authoring tools.</p>
<p>Kuesa is made of 3 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to supporting any compliant glTF 2.0 files, Kuesa provides <strong>plugins for content creation tools Blender and 3DS Max</strong> for creating glTF 2.0 files which support custom extensions.</li>
<li><strong>A Qt module designed to load, render and manipulate glTF 2.0 models in applications using Qt 3D</strong>, making it easy to do things like triggering animations contained in the glTF files, finding camera details defined by the designer, etc. It also includes a library of post processing effects which can be easily extended.</li>
<li><strong>Tools to help designers and developers inspect and optimise the models,</strong> including command line tools to automate the process</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post outlines the new features and changes in the 1.1.0 release.</p>
<p>The main objective for this release was to ensure compliance with the Khronos glTF 2.0 specification.<br />
We made sure that Kuesa works on a wide range of target hardware, be it desktop, mobile or embedded.<br />
In addition, a great deal of work has been put into a nice technical documentation, following the Qt standards.<br />
This documentation is available at the following address : <a href="https://kdab.github.io/kuesa/#"><strong>https://www.kdab.com/kuesa/</strong></a></p>
<p>Kuesa 1.1.0 supports Qt 5.12.5, 5.13 and the recently released Qt 5.14.</p>
<p><span id="more-547"></span></p>
<h2>Kuesa Ecosystem</h2>
<p>This release is marked by an ever-growing ecosystem of Kuesa-related tools, bindings and integrations.</p>
<p>First and foremost, full <strong>Python bindings</strong> for Kuesa have been developed &#8211; <a href="https://www.kdab.com/python-binding-for-kuesa/">learn more about this here</a>.<br />
Support for Kuesa extensions, such as layer support, is being worked on in the official Khronos Blender glTF exporter ; we will keep you posted about the progress on that.<br />
The 3DS Max Kuesa exporter can on its side be <a href="https://github.com/KDAB/kuesa-3dsmax">downloaded here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>gltfEditor</strong> (ex-assetpipelineeditor) has been improved, and a simple, minimal-dependency glTF 2 viewer has been implemented. It supports a few command line flags useful for testing and is simply named <strong>gltfViewer</strong>.</p>
<p>A new tool to process glTF 2.0 assets from the command line has been implemented. It is named <strong>assetprocessor</strong>.<br />
It allows for instance to compress meshes, and embed buffers in a glTF file or extract them.</p>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<p>Some tools have been renamed in order to make their main use case clearer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>assetpipelineeditor</strong> has been renamed <strong>gltfEditor</strong>.</li>
<li>The extension of shader graph save files has been changed from .qt3d to .graph (the files in <a href="https://github.com/KDAB/kuesa/tree/master/src/core/shaders/graphs">kuesa/src/core/shaders/graphs</a>).</li>
<li>The Material API has been refactored : all the properties on materials (<strong>MetallicRoughnessMaterial</strong>, <strong>UnlitMaterial</strong>) are now instead grouped in material-specific &#8220;Properties&#8221; class &#8211; <strong>MetallicRoughnessProperties</strong>, <strong>UnlitProperties</strong>. This allows to decouple the actual material logic from the parameters needed for rendering it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p><strong>glTF 2.0</strong> support has been greatly improved in this release. Morph targets, which were missing in Kuesa 1.0, are now available.</p>
<p>Support for a few extensions and niceties has been added :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>KHR_lights_punctual</strong> : this feature manifests itself through the new Kuesa.DirectionalLight, Kuesa.PointLight and Kuesa.SpotLight objects.</li>
<li><strong>KHR_materials_unlit</strong> : unlit materials are now also supported in glTF 2.0 files.</li>
<li>Support for loading GLB files (single-file binary glTF format) has landed</li>
<li>The GLTF2Importer now supports multiple glTF scenes.</li>
<li>Support for 2 UV sets was added as the spec requires it.</li>
<li>A BRDF look-up table texture is now used.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Kuesa API</strong> has been augmented in a few ways :<br />
The Kuesa API now provides a way to pass options to the parser, through the GLTF2Options C++ class and Kuesa.GLTF2Options QML object.</p>
<p>Post-processing filters have seen an overhaul, and can now leverage depth textures.<br />
In addition, a few new effects were implemented : depth-of-field and bloom.<br />
Bloom can be tested in the car scene demo, and all effects are showcased in the framegraph_scene test project.</p>
<figure id="attachment_20913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20913" style="width: 1170px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-20913 size-topteaser" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/car-bloom-1170x340.jpeg" alt="Car with bloom" width="1170" height="340" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20913" class="wp-caption-text">Not as shiny as the latest Corvette, but still with a heavy dose of bloom!</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Normals and tangents</strong> can now be automatically generated when missing (through the help of the MikkTSpace open-source library) &#8211; see the GLTF2Options.</p>
<p><strong>gltfEditor</strong> (ex-assetpipelineeditor) has gained a few new features, too :</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to configure the exposure, gamma, and the tonemapping algorithm in the settings.</li>
<li>The editor is able to save and load camera settings, under the camera pane.</li>
<li>Tangents can conveniently be generated from the user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few <strong>new examples and demos</strong> were added :</p>
<ul>
<li>A music box moved by a mechanical arm. Bonus points for who will find the original melody used in the demo <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_20906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20906" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-20906 " src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/musicbox-1.png" alt="music box" width="462" height="323" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20906" class="wp-caption-text">The music box demo</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>A demo of the various tonemapping algorithms implemented in Kuesa :</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_20904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20904" style="width: 668px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-20904 " src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/tonemapping.jpeg" alt="tonemapping" width="668" height="411" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20904" class="wp-caption-text">The various tonemapping filters available, as showcased in the tonemapping demo</figcaption></figure>
<h2>General improvements</h2>
<p>The codebase was thoroughly tested on a wide range of hardware ; as such, many fixes in multiple areas of the codebase were implemented.<br />
Various HiDPI and multisampling related issues were fixed. For instance, post-processing effects now support multisampling correctly.</p>
<p>Better performance was achieved for the car demo on low-power devices thanks to the use of pregenerated images for the user interface.</p>
<p>The tonemapping and PBR pipelines were also reworked. The changes fix color space issues in the frame graph, in particular with post-processing effects.<br />
The PBR rework also fixes various subtle rendering artefacts.</p>
<h2>Contributing to Kuesa</h2>
<p>An infrastructure change has been put in place during this release cycle : dissatisfied by the pull request UI of Github, we migrated the code review to an open Gerrit instance, linked with <a href="https://github.com/KDAB/Kuesa">our Github repository.</a></p>
<p>Finally, a big thanks to all the contributors for this new version :<br />
Jim Albamont, Robert Brock, Timo Buske, Juan Jose Casafranca, Jean-Michaël Celerier, Wieland Hagen, Sean Harmer, Mike Krus, Paul Lemire, David Morgan, Mauro Persano, Nuno Pinheiro, Allen Winter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://www.kdab.com/3d-interactions-with-qt-kuesa-and-qt-design-studio-part-1/">last post</a>, I went through a method of creating a simulated reflection with a simple scene. This time I&#8217;d like to take the technique and apply it to something a bit more realistic. I have a model of a car that I&#8217;d like to show off in <a href="https://www.kdab.com/kuesa/">KUESA<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, and as we know, KUESA doesn&#8217;t render reflections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/01-car_with_reflection.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20883 flt-cent" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/01-car_with_reflection.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p>Using the method discussed last time, I&#8217;d need to create an exact mirror of the object and duplicate it below the original, and have a floor that was partially transparent. This would be expensive to render if I duplicated every single mesh on the high poly model. Here, the model is X triangles &#8211; duplicating it would result in Y triangles &#8211; is it really worth it for a reflection?</p>
<p>However, if I could take a low poly version of the mesh and make it look like the high poly mesh this could then work. I could bake the materials onto a low poly mesh. Easy to do in blender</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/02-detailed_fake_reflection.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20884 flt-cent" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/02-detailed_fake_reflection.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p>Here I have a low poly object as the created reflection, with the baked materials giving the impression of much higher detail than physically exists. Using the same technique of applying an image texture as an alpha channel, I can fade out the mesh below to look more like a reflection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/03-detailed_alphaed_reflection.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20885 flt-cent" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/03-detailed_alphaed_reflection.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p>To further the illusion, I can also blur the details on the baked materials &#8211; this, along with the rough texture of the plane, gives more of a reflective look, especially when you consider that a rough plane would not give an exact reflection</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/04-car_cheap_reflection.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20886 flt-cent" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/04-car_cheap_reflection.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p>The good news is, it produces an effect similar to a reflection, which is what we want.</p>
<p>This is all very well for a static model, but how can I deal with an object that has animations, such as a car door opening? I&#8217;ll look into this in the next post</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.kdab.com/kuesa/">KUESA<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> </span>is a Qt module designed to load, render and manipulate <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">glTF 2.0</a> models in applications using Qt 3D.</p>
<p>Kuesa provides a C++ and a QML API which makes it easy to do things like triggering animations contained in the glTF files, finding camera details defined by the designer, etc.</p>
<p>It is a great tool so that designers and developers can share glTF based 3D assets.</p>
<p>With the upcoming release of Kuesa 1.1, we are introducing a python binding for Kuesa. This provides a simple yet powerful way for programmers to integrate glTF content in their python applications with just a few lines of code.</p>
<h2>Building Kuesa&#8217;s Python binding</h2>
<p>The first step is, of course, to build and install Kuesa itself. Instruction <a href="https://github.com/KDAB/kuesa#installation">are available here</a>, it&#8217;s a simple process. Kuesa is a Qt module so it typically installs inside Qt&#8217;s standard folders.</p>
<p>Next step is to install <a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python">Python for Qt</a>, AKA PySide. Note that you must install it for the same version of Qt that you compiled Kuesa with.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve built your own version of Qt, fear not. Building the python binding for that is fairly easy and quick.</p>
<p>In all cases, we would recommend you use a python virtual environment. This will let you install several versions of the Qt bindings.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed Python for Qt, you&#8217;re ready to build the Kuesa binding.</p>
<p>Building bindings for C++ libraries is a relatively simple process which uses several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a header file which includes all the C++ headers for the files you want to build bindings for</li>
<li>an xml file which lists all the classes and provides helper information for the binding generator. This contains details about enums, can help hide C++ methods or properties, etc</li>
<li>a binding generator, Shiboken which parses the C++ headers and generates C++ code that implements the binding</li>
</ul>
<p>The code for the binding, inside Kuesa&#8217;s src folder, contains a CMake project file which takes care of all the details.</p>
<p>So assuming the python virtual env is active and the right version of Qt is in the path, building the binding should be as easy as:</p>
<pre>cd .../src/python
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install</pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: the version of Python for Qt which ships with the 5.12 series is incomplete in it&#8217;s coverage of Qt 3D. In particular, some useful classes were missed in the animation module, like <tt>QClock</tt> which is useful to control the speed and the direction of the animation. We have submitted a patch for PySide which fixes this and it was merged in 5.13.</p>
<h2>Your first Kuesa application with Python</h2>
<p>Kuesa ships with a simple python application that demonstrates the use of the binding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20692" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Blank_Skitch_Document-1024x790.png" alt="" width="800" height="617" /></p>
<p>The application starts by importing the various required modules:</p>
<div>
<pre>from PySide2.QtCore import(Property, QObject, QPropertyAnimation, Signal, Slot)
from PySide2.QtGui import (QGuiApplication, QMatrix4x4, QQuaternion, QVector3D, QWindow)
from PySide2.QtWidgets import (QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QCheckBox, QPushButton, QApplication)
from PySide2.Qt3DCore import (Qt3DCore)
from PySide2.Qt3DRender import (Qt3DRender)
from PySide2.Qt3DExtras import (Qt3DExtras)
from PySide2.Qt3DAnimation import (Qt3DAnimation)
from Kuesa import (Kuesa)</pre>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene graph will need a <tt>SceneEntity</tt> and a <tt>GLTF2Import</tt> node to load the glTF content.</p>
<div>
<pre>self.rootEntity = Kuesa.SceneEntity()
self.rootEntity.loadingDone.connect(self.onLoadingDone)
self.gltfImporter = Kuesa.GLTF2Importer(self.rootEntity)
self.gltfImporter.setSceneEntity(self.rootEntity)
self.gltfImporter.setSource("file://"+ wd +"/../assets/models/car/DodgeViper-draco.gltf")</pre>
</div>
<p>It must also use the frame graph provided by Kuesa. This is needed for the custom materials that Kuesa uses for PBR rendering. It also provides performance improvements such as early z filling, and additional post-processing effects such as blurring or depth of field.</p>
<div>
<pre>self.fg = Kuesa.ForwardRenderer()
self.fg.setCamera(self.camera())
self.fg.setClearColor("white")
self.setActiveFrameGraph(self.fg)</pre>
</div>
<p><em>Note</em>: in this case, the base class is an instance of <tt>Qt3DWindow</tt> from Qt 3D&#8217;s extras module.</p>
<p>When loading is completed, the content of the glTF file can be accessed using the various collections that are available on the <tt>SceneEntity</tt> class. For example, you can access the animations created by the designer and baked into the glTF file. These can they be controlled from python!</p>
<div>
<pre>def onLoadingDone(self):
    self.hoodClock = Qt3DAnimation.QClock(self.rootEntity)
    self.hoodAnimation = Kuesa.AnimationPlayer(self.rootEntity)
    self.hoodAnimation.setClock(self.hoodClock)
    self.hoodAnimation.setSceneEntity(self.rootEntity)
    self.hoodAnimation.setClip("HoodAction")</pre>
</div>
<p>Referencing glTF content is done using the names assigned by the designer.</p>
<p>From there on, animations can be started and stopped by accessing the animation player object. Speed and direction can be changed using the clock created above.</p>
<p>Finally, the application embeds the <tt>Qt3DWindow</tt> inside a widget based UI (using a window container widget) and creates a simple UI to control the animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the first in a series of blog posts about 3D and the interaction with Qt, <a href="https://www.kdab.com/kuesa/">KUESA<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> and <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2019/04/01/qt-3d-studio-2-3-released/">Qt 3D Studio</a>, and other things that pop up when we&#8217;re working on something. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&#8217;m a 3D designer, mostly working in blender. Sometimes I come across interesting problems and I&#8217;ll try to share those here. For example, trying to display things on low-end hardware &#8211; where memory is sometimes limited, meaning every polygon and triangle counts;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>where the renderer doesn&#8217;t do what the designer wants it to, that sort of thing. </span><span class="s1">The problem that I&#8217;ll cover today is, how to easily create a reflection in KUESA or Qt 3D Studio. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Neither KUESA or Qt 3D Studio will give you free reflections. If you know a little about 3D, you know that requires ray tracing software, not OpenGL. </span><span class="s1">So, I wondered if there would be an easy way to create this effect. I mean, all that a reflection is, is a mirror of an object projected onto a plane, right? So, I wondered, could this be imitated?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter thumbnail flt-cent" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/01-simple_scene.png" alt="" width="700" align="middle" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To recreate this, I&#8217;d need to create an exact mirror of the object and duplicate it below the original, and have a floor that is partially transparent. I&#8217;ve created a simple scene to show you how this technique works &#8211; a scene with two cubes, a ground plane and a point light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s the result of this scene. It&#8217;s starting to look like <em>something</em>, but I want to compare it to a &#8216;real&#8217; reflection.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="thumbnail flt-cent aligncenter" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/03-rough_true" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></span><span class="s1">For comparison, the above is a cube on a reflective, rough surface &#8211; showing the result using raytracing. You can see here the reflection is different from our example above &#8211; the main issue is that the reflection eventually fades out the further away it gets from the contact point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How to resolve this? This can be mimicked by creating an image texture for the alpha that fades out the model towards the top (or rather the bottom) of the reflection. I can also further enhance the illusion by ensuring that the floor is rough &#8211; allowing the texture of the surface to assist the illusion of a reflection. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="thumbnail flt-cent aligncenter" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/02-without_alpha.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" align="centre" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another difference between the shots is the blurriness on the edge of the mesh &#8211; this could be approximated by creating duplicates of the mesh and for each one, increasing the size and reducing the opacity. Depending on the complexity of the model, this may add too many polygons to render, while only adding a subtle effect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" class="thumbnail flt-cent aligncenter" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/04-simple_cheap_reflection.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, given that this is a very simple example and not one that would translate well to something that a client might ask for, how can I translate this into a more complex model, such as the car below?
